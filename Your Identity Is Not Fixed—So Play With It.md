## [[Volution 1|Your Identity Is Not Fixed—So Play With It!]]
Nothing about who you are is truly fixed, your age being perhaps the most obvious evidence of it. You are not the number of years you’ve lived on this planet, you are a unique and wonderful and ideally omni-loving person.

The Census Model Of Identity is a mould that needs to be broken, dismantled and understood for its benefits _and_ its shortcomings, and then recreated to serve us better. If we answer identity questions the same old (boring) ways as before, we forgo the opportunity to make the world better by inspiring people to think differently about what identity means.  When you think of me, I don’t want you to think of “a 34-year old man”—I want you to think of Faruk. Catdragon and puppy. Time traveler. Love First Person. 

Something more unique to _me_. Something that actually represents who I am.
