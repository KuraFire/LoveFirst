## [[Volution 1|Age Is (Not) Just A Number]]
There is no inherent meaning to the year of your body’s birth.  One’s physical age does not represent one’s emotional maturity or spiritual development, yet because it’s the only thing we can numerically track easily we’ve put enormous importance on it. Arbitrary concepts like generations are shoved onto you without your consent, and their effective role has increasingly become polarizing, divisive, and limiting. I’m classified as a Millennial, but I care not about being forced into a shared identity defined by social researchers I’ve never heard of. 

There is value to these social constructs, don’t get me wrong: they help us understand shifts across society in economics, social justice, activism movements, political beliefs and ideologies, et cetera. We use generations and ages to _create_ meaning, but we’ve failed to identify the ways in which they hurt us and hold us back as people. Culturally, Boomers and Millennials seem in opposition to one another. Many people rebel against their parents, sire, but… should that be the defining dynamic of an entire age group?
