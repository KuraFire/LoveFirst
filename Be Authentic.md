## [[Volution 1|Be Authentic]]
The number of my corporeal years in this world does not feel like an authentic measure for me. I donâ€™t identify by my age, and I donâ€™t think people are served well by how much emphasis and meaning we place upon it. 

If you embrace your numerical age, if it feels authentic to you, and if it serves a _positive_ influence in your life to identify that way, then all the more power to you. Iâ€™m not here to tell you what to do or how to live; Iâ€™m here to show you that there are other ways of being, of identifying as a person, that are just as valid and legitimate. Ways that may ultimately serve you and our society a great deal better. 

But I can only show you the door. Youâ€™re the one that has to walk through it.

This Is Timeless. 

Happy birthday to all my fellow Octobots Prime! ðŸ¥³
