 # What Is Love First?
## The Answer

## [[This Is Just An Idea]]


## [[I Believe In Something]]

I believe I can change.
I believe I can build bridges across ideologies.


I believe I can fall in love again
	and again
		and again and again and again
each day. 
Over and over.

With myself.
With others.
With humanity.
With this planet 
	and all of its life and glory
		and splendor 
		and story
.

What in this life do _You_ care about?

Because for me, it’s _All Of It_.

…

…

…

Because it only takes 1️⃣ one person to join 1️⃣  one other person for “I” to become “We.”

And together, between the 8+ billion of us, *We* can do ***truly anything***.

## [[Try It On Sometime]]

See how it fits?

Say the first half of this post out loud to yourself.

If you want to give [[Love First]] a try.

[[So Why Not]] Try It On Sometime?

## [[What If]] [[Your Fridge Chooses Your Breakfast For You]]


We Finish Each Other’s •
	Sandwiches
	Sentences
	Stories
	Doubts


Sometimes, we simply want someone else to choose _for us_. To give us [[The Answer]]. To decide on our life _just_ so we can take a break from making life decisions all the damn time.



## [[I Want You To Decide On My Life]]

We as a people *can* love each other. Sometimes we forget.
I’ll remind you of what we already have.

Life isn't a puzzle that can just be solved one time and it's done. You wake up every day and you solve it again.


## [[Connect The Dots]]

Feelings are stronger than logic.

The Journey Is The Destination, so come on an adventure with me!
