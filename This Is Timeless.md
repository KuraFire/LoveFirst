# This Is Timeless

Today is my `-0x56` birthday, but for some time now I’ve had a much better answer to the question _“how old are you?”_

**I’m timeless.**

There are three distinct reasons I respond that way:

![[Age Is (Not) Just A Number#Volution 1 Age Is Not Just A Number]]


![[Your Identity Is Not Fixed—So Play With It#Volution 1 Your Identity Is Not Fixed—So Play With It]]


![[Be Authentic#Volution 1 Be Authentic]]
