Love First began as an idea: that it is possible for us to reimagine, evolve, and build our society on the foundations of love, by developing a much more thorough understanding of how love works, and cultivate it with greater intention in every area of life.

To make such an idea succeed, it would need two major touchstones at each end of the vast spectrum of human collaboration: at a high level, a [[North Star]] vision of the future that people could believe in; and at the micro-granular level, [[A Very Simple Idea]] that would entice people in an inclusive and accessible way.
